# rustracer
Ray tracer written in rust as an excuse to teach myself some rust. This is definitely a work in progress as there's some shadows, but no dynamic lighting and the repo needs some heavy reorganization. 

Feel free to borrow anything from this basic implementation.

Executing `cargo run` will build and execute the raytracer, and generate `output.bmp` from `scene.json`
